# FoQLens

Hi, I'm Vladimir Savkin. I studied mathematics and programming and hold a master's degree in fundamental computer science and information technology, and I work as a systems architect - distributed systems, lately with formal verification. FoQLens is my research. More about me: [CV](https://sawking.tech/cv).

**Does a language model need a fixed precision for every question?**

FoQLens raises the precision of the weights only where the question needs it.

**[foqlens.sawking.tech](https://foqlens.sawking.tech/)** - the idea, with the controls of the
regulator to move: base precision, the size and strength of the zones, how overlaps combine, and what
the setting costs in bits per weight. The metaphor they act on is drawn on real weights: the map of
Gemma 4 E2B, 14 708 blocks, blocks that light up together lying close.
[The documents](https://foqlens.sawking.tech/docs.html) - the mechanism, the preregistration and
every run - are on the same site.

The larger goal is a universal **precision regulator** - one mechanism that sets how finely a model works right now and makes it adaptive: to the task, to the machine it runs on and to the value of the query ([the idea](https://sawking.tech/blog/kvantovaniie-vsio-chto-vam-nuzhno)). One set of weights serves every device and every load: it runs lean on a phone or on a hot, busy server, and opens to full precision exactly where a query needs it. Under pressure it degrades gracefully - the background coarsens first, what the query needs stays sharp.

Mixture of Experts is its rigid special case: experts with hard edges fixed at training, opened by a router. The regulator makes experts continuous - zones emerge from the query itself, related topics share them, and the junction between two topics is sharpened instead of falling between two experts.

**The main hypothesis:** on a hard question the first pass gives a draft, most of it read at base precision - an approximate guess, and more useful than a refusal, since a guess can be refined. The draft goes back into the input with the refinement; the zones of the next step land more precisely, and the weights outside them affect the answer less. So where there are iterations - an agent, or a model's reasoning - the model should end better than the same model at native precision. It is tested once the FoQLens model exists: an agent on a hard multi-step task, such as designing a software architecture ([H4](docs/hypotheses.md)). Further out, a horizon: a network trained with zoning, read the same way, should beat a Mixture of Experts trained the classical way on the same data, holding no more in memory at any moment ([H5](docs/hypotheses.md)).

**FoQLens** (Focus + Quantization + Lens) is the model that uses this regulator. Its mechanism is **FoQZones** - focusable quantization zones: the precision of the weights is allocated by the meaning of the query, and the lens is its metaphor. This repository is the R&D inside FoQLens - a bench that tests the core of the idea: keep the weights that matter for *this particular query* at high precision and read the rest coarsely - and let the model itself say which weights those are ([goals](docs/goals.md)).

## The problem

Quantization makes models smaller and faster by storing weights with fewer bits. Every existing scheme - static or dynamic - decides precision per **fixed unit**: the whole model, a layer, a channel, a token, an MoE expert. The boundaries come from the architecture; a controller only chooses how many bits each unit gets.

You add 2 + 2 without thinking; a theorem in differential equations takes a while. A model answers both **at full power**. Ask it how a word is spelled and it still reads every one of its weights, so that question costs as much as the hardest one it can solve. And in everyday use such questions are most of them.

## The idea

1. Score every block of weights (64 output rows) by how much it matters for the query - from the model's own activations and gradients, no trained router.
2. Grow the query's **expert zones** from the peaks of that score, along a distance between blocks. Which score, which distance and how the zones grow are strategies still to be tested ([docs/zone-strategies.md](docs/zone-strategies.md)).
3. Read the whole network at a **base precision** and read each expert zone more precisely: sharpest at its center, falling off toward its edge.

Three controls, each doing one thing:

- **base precision** (`floor` in the scripts) - the precision of everything outside the zones, down to nothing at all;
- **focus_area** - the size of the zones;
- **focus_strength** - how far the zone centers rise above the base.

Memory is the result of the settings, and no budget is preset: a query that needs little gets small zones and pays little. The mechanism in formulas: [docs/precision-regulator.md](docs/precision-regulator.md).

If the idea holds, **expert zones emerge** as the regions that stay sharp when everything around them is coarsened - and related topics share part of their zone instead of paying for it twice, as MoE experts do.

## Where it leads

- **On-device models.** One weights file for a phone, glasses or a laptop: precision follows the battery, the heat and the free memory, and the zones stay where the query is.
- **Cost per query in data centers.** A simple question gets small zones and costs little; a hard one gets wider ones. The price of a token follows the question.
- **Agents and reasoning.** Wherever a draft is refined step by step - the main hypothesis above.
- **Graceful degradation.** Under load or heat the model gets coarser first in what the query does not need.

These are the directions the regulator opens; each is tested by its own step of the [plan](docs/goals.md).

## What the bench checks

The steps, numbered as in the [preregistration](prereg/), are ordered so each one can kill the next; where each stands is in the [roadmap](docs/goals.md):

| Step | Question | Kills the idea if |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Do topics separate in the model's representations at all? | they don't (then the model is too weak) |
| 1 | Are per-block masks similar within a topic and different between topics? Are they concentrated? | masks look the same for every query |
| 2 | Do related topics (biology-chemistry) share more of their zones than unrelated ones (biology-math)? | no overlap structure |
| 2+ | Geometry: are masks additive, is there a junction zone, does ablating it break mixed questions only? | - (refining, not load-bearing) |
| 3 | How much of what the model knows do the query's zones keep, against uniform quantization at the same memory? The other topic's zones and generic importance test the address | the zones keep no more than uniform quantization at the same memory |
| 7 | In an agent chain of a draft and refinements, does the zone model end better than the same model at native precision and than uniform quantization at the same memory? (the main hypothesis, once the model exists) | - |

The predictions and their criteria are in the [preregistration](prereg/); the full reasoning is in [`docs/`](docs/).

## Experiments

| Experiment | What it showed |
| --- | --- |
| [E001](experiments/E001-uniform-quantization/results.md) | Naive rounding leaves D2 incoherent; on questions the model does not know, the coarser model answers where the precise one refuses |
| [E002](experiments/E002-base-precision-d2/results.md) | A working base precision over k-quants: the ladder keeps 98.8 / 96.8 / 91.0 / 51.4% of what the whole model knows |
| [E003](experiments/E003-calibrated-base/results.md) | A base calibrated with an imatrix raised D2 by 25.3 points at a cost of 0.7 at D6 |
| [E004](experiments/E004-question-address/results.md) | The address of a query is cheap to read: a paraphrase is read as the same query in 0.917 of the cases against 0.717 for a bag of its tokens, and the first 4-8 layers at base precision are enough |
| [E005](experiments/E005-precision-map/results.md) | An ideal precision map for a query holds 0.816 of the top rung's answers at 0.523 of its memory; the uniform D4, costing more, gives 0.000 |
| [E006](experiments/E006-filter-map-retention/_index.md) | Sharpness set by the address of the query takes 26 hard questions of 50 at 0.516 of the top rung's memory; the flat D6 at 0.775 takes 7. The bounds of the field scale are computed from the ladder's own measurement |

The maps are built by oracles. The
regulator that works out a layout on its own is being built.

## Status

**The bench, the corpus and the kernel are ready; the map for a query is measured, the regulator is in the works.**

**The corpus of what the model knows is built and frozen:** the full model answered every question of six
datasets in its own words, with no options anywhere, and a question stays if the answer is right; three
regimes in it - the answer in a passage, only in the weights, across two passages and a step. The corpus has
20,640 questions: 18,576 the model knows and 2,064 it does not
([docs/corpus.md](docs/corpus.md)).

**How the model holds its knowledge under uniform quantization is measured:** over a base calibrated with an
imatrix D8 keeps 97.5% of what the full model knows, D6 96.2%, D4 90.8%, D2 76.7%. This is the baseline for every
test of the filter, and the filter is tested from D2 ([E003](experiments/E003-calibrated-base/results.md)). Over
the bench's own k-quant base the same ladder keeps 98.8%, 96.8%, 91.0% and 51.4%
([E002](experiments/E002-base-precision-d2/results.md)): the calibrated base raised D2 by 25.3 points at a cost of
0.7 at D6 and 1.3 at D8. Knowledge goes from the weights first: with the answer in the passage D4 loses 2.5%, with
the answer only in the weights 13.0% (E002). On the first measurement naive rounding made D2 incoherent
([E001](experiments/E001-uniform-quantization/results.md)).

**A layout built for the query holds knowledge more cheaply than a uniform rung.** Over 103 questions only the top rung answers, a map built for the query gives 0.816 of the right answers at 0.523 bytes of the whole model; the uniform D4 at 0.558 bytes gives 0.000 and the uniform D6 at 0.775 gives 0.039. A common map that knows no query gives 0.544 at the same price: the gap to 0.816 is what knowing the query is worth ([E005](experiments/E005-precision-map/results.md)).

**The address of a query is cheap to read.** The hybrid of neuron activity and head energy reads a paraphrase as the same query in 0.917 of the cases against 0.717 for a bag of its tokens, and the first 4-8 layers at base precision give the same address as a full pass ([E004](experiments/E004-question-address/results.md)). The depth of the reading cannot be chosen from the query.

**The premise of the main hypothesis came up on its own.** On the questions the full model does not know, the
coarser model answers where the precise one refuses: in E001 on HotpotQA bf16 says the passages hold no answer in
12.1% of them, D4 in 4.6%, and the accepted answers rise from 13.4% to 25.2%. Coarsening removes the caution and adds
no knowledge, and the guess is sometimes right. That is what [H4](docs/hypotheses.md) stands on: a draft guess can
be refined, "I don't know" cannot. A class of tasks that shows it on purpose is an experiment of its own.

**Next, the regulator:** the model builds the same layout itself, without seeing the answer - from the address of a query or as the pass runs.

**The question all of it serves:** is there a cheap precision regulator - one that gives the structure where a
coarse reading is enough, the details where sharpness is needed, and a gain over iterations. Saving memory is a secondary goal, plan B: even without
a gain in quality the mechanism saves memory at the same usability.

**Engineering:** one stored copy of the weights read at 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 bits: a k-quant base with 2-bit
refinements over it, after MoBiQuant with departures ([E002](experiments/E002-base-precision-d2/results.md)). The
base is the blocks of a published Q2_K file calibrated with an imatrix (bartowski), as they lie in it
([E003](experiments/E003-calibrated-base/results.md)). The zones' top rung is D8; the model's file may also hold
a tail to the source weights of any type, so the model reads back its source bit for bit without the checkpoint
([docs/refocustensors.md](docs/refocustensors.md)). A layout of depths is read by a CUDA kernel on tensor cores
straight from the copy's bytes, every block of rows to its depth: a decoding step of E2B-it at a mixed layout takes
28.8 ms at a batch of 32 against 422.6 unpacked and 20.4 at bf16 ([docs/kernels.md](docs/kernels.md)); a prefill
unpacks the copy for a GEMM.

## Reproduce

Requirements: an NVIDIA GPU with 16 GB+ of memory, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). uv fetches Python 3.12 by itself.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sawking-tech/FoQLens.git
cd FoQLens
uv sync                                              # torch (CUDA 12.8), transformers, bitsandbytes
uv run python scripts/download_models.py e2b e2b-it   # Gemma 4 E2B and E2B-it at their pinned revisions, ~20 GB
uv run python scripts/cut_model.py e2b-it            # the bench's model: E2B-it as .refocustensors, ~9.3 GB
uv run pytest                                        # unit + bench health tests on the GPU
```

A run takes 0.8 of the GPU by default - that share of the VRAM, and rest between batches - so the card stays usable; `--gpu-share 1` or `FOQLENS_GPU_SHARE=1` gives the full speed.

Model weights are not stored in the repository. `scripts/download_models.py` fetches them from Hugging Face (Apache 2.0, no token needed) at the commits pinned in `foqlens.model.REVISIONS`, and `foqlens.model.load()` reads exactly those commits. `scripts/cut_model.py` cuts a downloaded model into its [.refocustensors](docs/refocustensors.md) folder outside the repository, and the bench runs from that folder. Add `e4b` to the download for the confirmation model (~16 GB).

## Order of work

Preregistration → run code → runs → results, each in its own commit, so the history shows the predictions came before the data. Analysis is blind: all runs first, then everything is opened at once. The only exception is step 0, a check that the model is fit for the bench at all.
